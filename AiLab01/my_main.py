"""
Consider a Sudoku game - a logic puzzle represented on a n x n board; some squares
contain already a number, others must be completed with other numbers from {1,2,…,n} in such
a way that each line, column and square with the edge equal with √n must contain only different
numbers. Determine one correct solution for the puzzle
